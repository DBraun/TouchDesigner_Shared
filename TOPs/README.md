### 2D_texture_array_averager.tox - 2D Texture Array Averager
This will take a 2D Texture Array (from a Texture3D TOP) and add the layers together according to a geometric distribution. If the falloff is F, the most recent layer is weighted by 1.0, the second most recent by 1.0*F, the third by 1.0*F^2 and so on. If F is 1.0, then the result is like a Box Filter over the Cache (every layer is weighted equally). If F is 0.0, then only the most recent layer is shown.

### bloom_filter.tox - Bloom Filter
My version of a bloom filter based on what I've read and seen in a few places. It thresholds an image, blurs it, levels it, and adds that top of the original image. It has two stages. The second stage uses the first blur pass as its input rather than the thresholded image. In this way, the blur is cumulative.

### Blur_and_Composite.toe - Blur and Composite

http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/palettes/palettes.htm Use the TOP to CHOP to figure out what the parameters do. This uses the BCH color space. Behind the scenes it uses some extra trigonometry, but you can try to keep the parameters between 0 and 1. The final clamp occurs in RGB space.

### color_palette_rgb_trigonometric.tox - Color Palette RGB Trigonometric
http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/palettes/palettes.htm Use the TOP to CHOP to figure out what the parameters do.

### OpticalFlow.tox - Optical Flow
Optical Flow visualizes the movement in an image. The red channel represents horizontal motion, and the green channel represents vertical motion. This tox also provides two debug modes for fine-tuning the optical flow parameters. The first mode is "Normal", which uses arrows to indicate the velocity around a region. The second mode is "Shading" which puts bright colors in high-motion areas and leaves inactive areas alone. Major portions of this tox come from reading the source code of [PixelFlow](https://github.com/diwi/PixelFlow/) (MIT License). Beware that the output is just an Red-Green channel image.
