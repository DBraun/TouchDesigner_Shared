[![Demo Video Screenshot](https://img.youtube.com/vi/QoRlam0XAiU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoRlam0XAiU "Weighted Voronoi Stippling in TouchDesigner")

Inspired by: [https://github.com/MarcSpicker/LindeBuzoGrayStippling](https://github.com/MarcSpicker/LindeBuzoGrayStippling)

Brought to TouchDesigner (with some changes) by David Braun. At the moment, it only works on Windows due to its usage of imageAtomicAdd.
