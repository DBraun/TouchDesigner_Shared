### Bezier GUI

* Left-click on green dots to move points. Note that some points are locked and can't be moved with the mouse. Whether or not a point is locked is controlled by the "lock" column in the keys_internal DAT.
* You can right-click to delete non-locked points.
* You can alt-left-click to insert points. You can insert in between existing points or elongate existing lines. Note that if multiple Bezier COMPs share the same Keys DAT, you can modify one and affect *all* of them!
* You can click line segments and toggle the interpolation mode between bezier and linear.
* You can zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse.
* You can middle-mouse drag to pan the camera.
