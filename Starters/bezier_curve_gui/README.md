### Bezier GUI

Left-click on green dots to move points. Note that some points are locked and can't be moved with the mouse.. Whether or not a point is locked is controlled by the "lock" column in the keys_internal DAT. You can shift-right-click to delete non-locked points. You can alt-left-click to insert points.
