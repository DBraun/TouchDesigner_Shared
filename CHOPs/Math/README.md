### cross_product.tox - Cross Product
Calculate the cross product of two vectors.

### smoothstep.tox - Smoothstep
The smoothstep function returns 0.0 if x is smaller then edge0 and 1.0 if x is larger than edge1. Otherwise the return value is interpolated between 0.0 and 1.0 using Hermite polynomials. See [Smoothstep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep)

### smootherstep.tox - Smoother Step
The smoothstep function returns 0.0 if x is smaller then edge0 and 1.0 if x is larger than edge1. Otherwise the return value is interpolated between 0.0 and 1.0 using Ken Perlin's improved version of the smoothstep function which has zero 1st and 2nd order derivatives at x=0 and x=1.
