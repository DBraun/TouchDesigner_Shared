### analyze_variance.tox - Analyze Variance (standard deviation)
Calculate the standard deviation of a series of CHOP samples.

### calculate_compact_tex_size.tox - Calculate Compact Texture Size
For a given integer, factor it into two integers. (Not optimized or robust)

### catmull_rom.tox - Catmull Rom Spline
Turn a list of XY points into a [Centripetal Catmull-Rom spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline)

### cross_product.tox - Cross Product
Calculate the cross product of two vectors.

### normalize.tox - Normalize
Normalize a vector (divide it by its length).

### numpy_distance_pairs.tox - Numpy Distance Pairs
Calculate and sort distances of all pairs of points.

### smoothstep.tox - Smoothstep
The smoothstep function returns 0.0 if x is smaller then edge0 and 1.0 if x is larger than edge1. Otherwise the return value is interpolated between 0.0 and 1.0 using Hermite polynomials. See [Smoothstep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep)

### smootherstep.tox - Smoother Step
The smoothstep function returns 0.0 if x is smaller then edge0 and 1.0 if x is larger than edge1. Otherwise the return value is interpolated between 0.0 and 1.0 using Ken Perlin's improved version of the smoothstep function which has zero 1st and 2nd order derivatives at x=0 and x=1.
